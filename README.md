# Password-Generator

A simple password generator in **C++**.

---

## Features

- The user can choose:
  - The length of the password.
  - Whether the password will include:
    - Uppercase letters.
    - Lowercase letters.
    - Numbers.
    - Special characters.
- The program will ask the user if they want to **save the password**.
- If the user chooses to save it, they will be prompted to provide a **name for the password** before saving.
- By default, passwords are saved in:  
  `"/home/Passwords/password.txt"`  
  *(You can change this by modifying the `adress` variable in the code).*
