# Password-Generator
 A simple password generator in C++

 The user can choose the legth of the password and 
 if the generator will use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, 
 and special character.
 Then the program will ask the user if wants to save the password, and it will ask a name for the password,
 before the password will be saved. (Per default in: "/home/miguel/contrasenas.txt". You can change it by changing the adress variable).

 All the code an the comments are in spanish.
 Sorry if I made a mistake while writting this in english.
